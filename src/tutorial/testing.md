# Testing

TBD...

(show nodejs env unit testing with tape. Because of DI, mock dndService is simple.)

(talk about browser env testing. For unit test on controller without view, can do the same mock test as nodejs env. For test with html view, just use real DndService, has a look at `bcx-aurelia-dnd` test code on how to issue mouse event for a dnd session.)
